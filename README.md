## 📋 Project Description
This project aims to practice real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The following are scenarios that are manipulated on the DOM:
- Building the navigation menu dynamically.
- Building a Responsive nav bar for the small screen.
- Hiding the nav bar when scrolling down and scrolling up makes it appear again
- Hiding fixed navigation bar while not scrolling.
- Adding a scroll to the top button on the page that’s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
- Adding an active state to navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Adding an active state to sections when a section is in the viewport.
- Scrolling to the sections using nav bar elements when clicking on them.
- Making sections collapsible.

Note:
Html and CSS files have been given by Udacity to practice manipulating the DOM. and have edited some parts.
